\opening{Dear Prof. Williamson,}
I am herewith submitting my paper titled ``On Kernel Mengerian Orientations of Line Multigraphs'' for review at the SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics (SIDMA). 

The paper mainly presents a polyhedral description of kernels in orientations of line multigraphs. It shows that the linear system defining fractional kernels is totally dual integral (TDI) for each induced subdigraph $D'$ of digraph $D$ if and only if $D$ is a kernel perfect orientation of a line multigraph. The result in this paper strengthens the theorem of Borodin \textit{et al.} on kernel perfect digraphs and generalizes the theorem of Kir\'{a}ly and Pap on stable matching problem.

%In particular, the ideas developed in both papers are presented under the unified view, many missing proofs have been added and many details regarding the model etc. have been clarified. The presentation has also been improved.

%We would like to suggest Prof. Eli Upfal as an editor to handle the paper.

%We request your help in speeding up the review process and would be happy to help in any way we can.

Thank you very much for your help.

\closing{Best regards,}
\end{letter}
